I suffer from _finishitis_: the chronic inability to complete all the projects I start.

This disease manifests in every medium. My desk groans under the weight of unfinished writing, coding, knitting, and other art projects.

As the mother of a five-month old, I've lost the luxury of free time and free space in my small Brooklyn apartment. I am tired of the guilty thoughts cluttering my head. I need the space back in my mental To Do List. It's time to push through the discomfort, let go of the perfectionism and get things done.

Inspired by NaNoWriMo, I've decided to embark on a 30 Day challenge this November to spend at least 30 minutes a day bringing some of my nearly-done side projects to completion. I'll post each day to document my progress. I'm not promising beautiful work. I am focusing on _done_. Hopefully this will free up some headroom and kick finishitis once and for all.

[Follow me](https://www.instagram.com/lizzardl/) to help keep me accountable and share your own triumphs over [finishitis](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/finishitis/?hl=en). I'll see you on the done side.
