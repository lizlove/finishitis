- [To Do list](#to-do-list)
- [Completed Projects ](#completed-projects)

I suffer from _finishitis_: the chronic inability to complete all the projects I start.

This disease manifests in every medium. My desk groans under the weight of unfinished writing, coding, knitting, and other art projects.

As the mother of a young child, I've lost the luxury of free time and free space in my small Brooklyn apartment. I am tired of the guilty thoughts cluttering my head. I need the space back in my mental To Do List. It's time to push through the discomfort, let go of the perfectionism and get things done.

Inspired by NaNoWriMo, I undertook on a 30 Day challenge in November 2019 to spend at least 30 minutes a day bringing some of my nearly-done side projects to completion. After one month, I finished one crochet baby blanket and built this site. üéäüçæüß∂ This was a whole lot less work than I'd initially imagined, but I was pleased that I checked at least one item off my list.

Each month since then, I've taken on another 30-day challenge to complete past projects. üë©üèª‚Äçüíª I'll post periodically to document my progress and take stock of what I'm learning.

I'm not promising beautiful work. I am focusing on _done_. Hopefully this will free up some headroom and kick finishitis once and for all.
