## Lesson in Lessness

30 days have passed. What do I have to show for myself? I had endevoured to complete loads of projects, but what did I actually finish?

_**One baby blanket.**_

This was far less than I had originally hoped, but it seems lessness is my lesson for this month.

For starters, in committing to blog daily about my progress, I inadvertently made one project two. As a parent to a small child and full-time employee, I had only enough time each day to do a bit of work or post on said work, but not both. After 4 days, I chose to give up blogging in favor of actual productivity.

30 minutes a day for 30 days turns out to have been just about the time I needed to crochet one blanket. It seems that I radically underestimate the time I actually need to complete anything - especially when it is the first time that I've undertaken a task.

## What I finished

I finished [this lovely shell crochet blanket](https://melaniekham.com/turtle-shell-crochet-blanket/) for baby O's naptime. It's warmer than the lightweight crocheted Blankie he recieved at birth from my lovely Aunt Nancy but still plenty breatheable. Blanket photography is not particularly interesting, so [Senior Goodboi, Lenny](https://www.instagram.com/lillenlen/) pitched in to help with the documentation.

## What I learned

While I had expected to be thrilled or at least relieved at finishing the blanket. My first thought was actually disappointment. The blanket is a bit boring and the stitches wobbly on the edges. I was em·bar·rassed to have made such a public declaration and too achieve so little.

_However_ flight from this critical voice and feelings of disappointment is the driver of my finishitis.

I want perfection, I want beauty, I want to be more than I feel that I am or ever will be. I find myself lacking and my shortcomings depressing.

My mental drumbeat of `not enough` thumps on louder than ever, or perhaps I am noticing that inner voice more as my time and resources are stretched further as a new parent.

I can look out and blame culture and capitalism or look inward and label anxiety.

Either way, this kind of thinking keeps me small and ashamed. If I do nothing, I get nothing. I only improve if I keep going. I chose to own my small actions and keep going.

## What is next

I'd like to keep up my habit of 30 minutes of daily project time with work on my ok,not-ok web project. Ideally, I can get this completed by the new year! I'll endeavor to update when I can!

## Misc

Want to read other people owning up to finishitis and failure, in 2010 Artist Cory Arcangel put together a project called [“Sorry I Haven’t Posted”](http://www.coryarcangel.com/news/2010/08/sorry-i-havnt-posted/) cataloging people apologizing to the internet for not posting.
