## What I finished

Today baby O is fighting a bug üëæ and he isn't really sleeping well. I have a feeling I'll be up with him a bit more tonight. üò© So, I scrambled to find on an activity I could pick up and put down in small stretches - crochet! I've been working on [this turtle shell crochet blanket](https://melaniekham.com/turtle-shell-crochet-blanket/) for Otis. I started last winter and _shocker_ did not complete. Below is my goal blanket measuring 30 x 30 inches. I'm at about 30 x 20 now so I don't have too many hours of work remaining.

## What is next

Tomorrow if Otis is better, I'll resume work on Ok, Not Ok and try to get the database populated with dummy data. Otherwise, I'll keep crocheting in 10-minute spurts while tending to him at night.

## What I let go

I wish I had been able to get to coding tonight, but it seems that other than this blog post, I'll be up and down with the baby for a few hours. I need enough time to really get my head around a problem in order to make any progress so I've had to let go of 10-minute code sprints as being productive at all.
I also had to let go of my ideas about this project and get real about the fact that my mom job is my primary gig, so I'll need to make sure that this work can adjust accordingly.

## Misc

I purchased the yarn for this project last fall [School Products Yarn](https://schoolproductsyarns.com/), located on an upper floor just south of Midtown in Manhattan. They claim to be the oldest yarn store in the city and seem to be the only shop without a punny name (take that Knitty City). I wanted a natural fiber that would be warm but not irritating to baby skin, so I decided to venture out of my comfort zone and try a shop that seems to service the professional yarn user. I was nonetheless plesantly surprised by the assortment of high-quality wool yarn at reasonable prices. The staff was gracious with an amateur and informative. üëçüëç
