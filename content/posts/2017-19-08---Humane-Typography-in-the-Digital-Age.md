## What I finished

I wrote the about page, contact page, and first blog post. I setup now deployment and deployed the site. I wrote an Instagram post.

_Putting the website live!_

But, through this transition, the book lost a large part of its humanity. The machine took over most of the process but craftsmanship was still a part of it. The typefaces were cut manually by the first punch cutters. The paper was made by hand. The illustrations and ornaments were still being hand drawn. These were the remains of the craftsmanship that went almost extinct in the times of Eric Gill.

## What is next

Tomorrow I start on my other incomplete website, Ok, Not Ok. I hope to evaluate its completeness and setup a prod database in preparation for deployment.

## What I let go

I'm using an [off-the-shelf Gatsby starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen/). I let go of fabulous design.

I spent more time than I needed to writing and re-writing my intro paragraph because I accidentally deleted the first version. I let go of comparing this version to the first one.

## Misc

The paragraph and header below are the dummy text that comes with this Gatsby

## Chasing perfection

Human beings arenâ€™t perfect. Perfection is something that will always elude us. There will always be a small part of humanity in everything we do. No matter how small that part, we should make sure that it transcends the limits of the medium. We have to think about the message first. What typeface should we use and why? Does the typeface match the message and what we want to communicate with it? What will be the leading and why? Will there be more typefaces in our design? On what ground will they be combined? What makes our design unique and why? This is the part of humanity that is left in typography. It might be the last part. Are we really going to give it up?
