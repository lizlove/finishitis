## What I finished

Unfortunately last night, Otis was up every hour and fussy most of the day, fighting his naps. I am a zombie üßü‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Parker is on duty tonight but I simply don't have the brain power to dive into much coding. With that in mind, I'm continuing work on [this turtle shell crochet blanket](https://melaniekham.com/turtle-shell-crochet-blanket/). 30 minutes of crochet while listening to a podcast seems like a glorious respite. Here is what i have so far.

## What is next

Tomorrow I'm looking forward to getting back onto Ok, Not Ok and to try to get the database populated with dummy data.

## What I let go

I feel like my finishitis is often exacerbated by unrealistic expectations and a failure to identify priorities. I can set aside 30 minutes a day for coding but only if I am not already occupied with a sick child or too tired to frankly think.

## Misc

According to Ars Technica, [researchers succesffully hackeds Siri, Alexa, and Google Home by shining lasers at them](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/11/researchers-hack-siri-alexa-and-google-home-by-shining-lasers-at-them/). The physics and practicality of this attack is facinating. All the more reason to be very judicious about adding IOT objects to your home and office!
