## What I finished

Unfortunately, last night Otis was up every hour and fussy most of the day. He fought every one of his naps with the ferocity of a five-month old who wants to crawl and brawl, y'all. I am a zombie üßü‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è operating on a handful of 30 minute snapshots of sleep.

Dad has stepped up to handle overnight duty tonight. This might have freed me up to work, but I simply don't have the brain power üôÖüèªüß† to dive into much coding. With that in mind, I'm continuing work on [this turtle shell crochet blanket](https://melaniekham.com/turtle-shell-crochet-blanket/). 30 minutes of crochet while listening to a podcast seems like a glorious respite. üå¶Ô∏è Here is my workstation for tonight.

I also made a few small improvements to this site: updated the favicon, fixed image storage, and updated the icon styling on landing.

## What is next

Tomorrow I'm looking forward to getting back onto Ok, Not Ok and to try to get the database populated with dummy data.

## What I let go

I feel like my finishitis is often exacerbated by unrealistic expectations and a failure to identify priorities. I can set aside 30 minutes a day for coding but only if I am not already occupied with a sick child or too tired to frankly think. Perhaps a better long term habit is to over-estimate the time that things require and under-estimate my deliverables to build in baby time. As a smart mom told me, once your child is born you will always be running 15 minutes behind.

## Misc

According to Ars Technica, [researchers succesffully hackeds Siri, Alexa, and Google Home by shining lasers at them](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/11/researchers-hack-siri-alexa-and-google-home-by-shining-lasers-at-them/). The physics and practicality of this attack is facinating. All the more reason to be very judicious about adding IOT objects to your home and office! I've been tempted to set up something to allow our childcare provider to play music with vocal recognition but I think this has successfully deterred me from the purchase.
