## What I finished

I got back into the Ok, Not Ok website. Due to a security warning in the repo, I upgraded the npm packages with `npm audit fix.` I set up a fresh set of env variables including a new database in MongoDB Atlas as previous iterations of the site used MLab, which is no longer with us. I updated the mongoose connection calls with new params to handle depreciated functions.

## What is next

Tomorrow I fill in the prod database with starter content and migrate my TODO list to the README file to discern what needs doing next!

## What I let go

A quick search in the repo surfaced a half dozen TODO comments that seem too fiddly to be worth time right now. For example, I have a TODO to add animated gifs demo-ing the site and embed them into the README. `<!-- TODO: Replace with gifs from hosted site -->`

_Sleep_ When I sat down to work at my customary 9PM, my laptop was dead and unable to be brought into bed with me. I'd been up all night yesterday with a sick baby, so I seriously considered scrapping this whole project or faking a post. _BUT_ I sucked it up, found a wall plug at my in-laws (where we are staying) and got to work after waiting 30 minutes for a laptop charge.

## Misc

[This episode](https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=758048712) of NPR's Rough Translation dives into the paradoxes in the current French labor market as seen through the eyes of a single McDonald's in the Northern Edge of Marsaille. Workers, lead by a charismatic man named Kamal, found in McDo a path to more full citizenship and engagement in French labor market. McDo offered a kind of tolerant employment that fostered growth in its employees despite their bad attitudes. The result was intense loyalty from those who had been say, taught to read by management or given a second, third and foruth chace after going missing off the job for months at a time. Now, after a sale to another franchisee the staff strikes to keep their jobs.
