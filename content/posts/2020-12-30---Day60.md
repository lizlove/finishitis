## Announcing Ok, Not Ok

30 more days have passed. We are nearly in another decade. What do I have to show for myself?

I finally completed a website project I started in 2018!

**_Cue the confetti._** ðŸŽŠ

[Announcing Ok, Not Ok](bit.ly/39wK4OJ) a website that allows you to get feedback about your _questionable_ encounters around sex, power, and the workplace. Not sure how you feel after an odd interaction? Post it on Ok, Not Ok and get live feedback. Bounce through the pages, rate others interactions as `Ok` or `Not Ok` and see how overall feedback breaks down according to gender.

Admittedly, this site was conceived of in the height of _#metoo_ but I feel like it still has relevance in our current terribly awkward world.

Do please check out the site and share your stories!

## What I finished

I finished [Ok, Not Ok](https://melaniekham.com/turtle-shell-crochet-blanket/) a website with a Node.JS backend, a Jade aka Pug front end, Sass stylesheet, and a MongoDB.

## What I learned

I went into the project with very little experience writing Mongoose / MongoDB queries. This project was my opportunity to learn that database and I've put both to use in subsequent work projects.

I learned that setting up a site for deployment can be a huge time drain. I also learned that untouched projects can become quickly reliant on obsolete tech, especially if you are operating on the free tier.

I had built the project with an mLab database and a Zeit now deployment. In the intervening years, mLab was purchased by MongoDB and depreciated and Zeit now moved to a serverless Lambda framework that wasn't going to work without extensively rewriting the backend.I opted to update with a fresh MongoDB and move the entire project over to Heroku deployment.

Given that this was the month of holidays, end of year deadlines, and Oti's first Christmas, I had less day-on-day time to get my work done. I found that sitting down for 30 minutes wasn't super effective in getting work accomplished when I was relying on documentation to say migrate databases or debug environmental variable issues.

In order to make this final push, I actually arranged for a day of childcare during my holiday break and holed myself up at my sisters office apartment.

## What is next

Ok. Not Ok has a few remaining features to address: randomizing the story order without repeats, fixing the sessions to prevent repeat ratings of a single story by a user, and any style fixes that come down the pike from my designer collaborator.

As for my next project, I'd like to continue this project for 2020! I have a lot of work deadlines this month - professional finishitis in full effect. With that in mind, I'm aiming to tackle the bugs on Ok, Not Ok and fix my personal site to include this project and have the proper authorization.

## What I let go

I had to let go of getting the randomization done as well as a final polish on design before deploying. I spent an unintelligent amount of time try to make a hacky randomizer going, but realized I just needed to push through to done.

Similarly, I think the results and story pages need a bit of work, but I simply didn't have the time to refine them more.

## Misc

- I recomended [Luc Sante's The Other Paris](https://www.bookforum.com/print/2203/luc-sante-s-flaneur-s-eye-guide-to-the-underside-of-paris-14966), an exploration of the marginal people and places in historical Paris, several times this holiday break. The attention to working class entertainments and spaces seems somehow resonnant to me right now. Even though contemporary urban space makes less and less room for this kind of demonstrative physical underbelly, the impulses to carve a collective working people's psychic space in the face of external insanity feels particularly current.

Free from daytime work obligations, I walked through a few personal ghost landscapes of New York City this holiday break registering the feelings of _home-ishness_ that well up on various points. Perhaps it is parenthood, but I'm feeling older and also more nostalgic for the terrain and the physical markers that imprinted on me in my first few years in the City. I find that the _homeishness_ feeling does not map to length of time in a particular place or frequency of visits, but more to a sense of authenticity or to how tightly I gripped those places to attempt to adhere them to a self that seemed dangerously mutable at the time.
