## Announcing Ok, Not Ok

30 more days have passed. We are nearly in another decade. What do I have to show for myself?

I finally completed a website project I started in 2018!

(Cue the confetti)

**_Ok, Not Ok_** ðŸŽŠ

_Ok, Not Ok_ is a website that allows you to get feedback about your _questionable_ encounters around sex, power, and the workplace. Not sure how you feel after an odd interaction? Post it on _Ok, Not Ok_ and get live feedback. Bounce through the pages, rate others interactions as `Ok` or `Not Ok` and see how overall feedback breaks down according to gender.

Admittedly, this site was conceived of in the height of _#metoo_ but I feel like it still has relevance in our awkward, shitty world. I've turned the code over to my collaborators for content editing and copy fixes. Keep your eyes open for the official release announcement.

## What I finished

_Ok, Not Ok_, a website built on the following stack:

- [MongoDB (Atlas)](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

I spent most of my time this month updating old versions of various dependencies and migrating the database and hosting. Shout out to [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/) whose Node/Pug tutorials I completed years ago and which I used as a jumping off point for this project.

## What I learned

I went into the project with very little experience writing MongoDB queries and using Mongoose as an ODM to manage organization. I've put both tools to use in subsequent work projects, so I'm glad to have had this dummy test opportunity.

I learned that reconfiguring a site for deployment after it has been built with a particular set of tools can be a bigger time drain than you might imagine. I also learned that untouched projects can become quickly reliant on obsolete tech, especially if you are operating on the free tier.

I had built the project with an mLab database and a Zeit now deployment. In the intervening years, mLab was purchased by MongoDB and depreciated and Zeit now moved to a serverless Lambda framework that wasn't going to work without extensively rewriting the backend. I opted to update with a fresh MongoDB and move the entire project over to Heroku deployment.

I learned the value of fewer, longer stretches to get real work accomplished. 30 minutes was not sufficient time to migrate a database or debug environment issues. In order to finally finish the work in the month, I arranged for a full-day of childcare during my holiday break.

## What is next

As I mentioned, I've turned _Ok. Not Ok_ over to my collaborators. I anticipate there will be forthcoming feedback to address.

I'd also like to tackling the following:

- randomizing the story order without repeats
- update sessions to prevent repeat ratings of a single story by a user

I'd also like to continue this project(finishitis) for 2020! I have a lot of work deadlines this month - professional finishitis is also in full effect - but ðŸ¤žI can keep this going.

## What I let go

I had to let go of getting the randomization done as well as a final polish on design before deploying. I spent an unintelligent amount of time try to make a hacky randomizer going, but realized I just needed to push through to done.

Similarly, I think the results and story pages need a bit of work, but I simply didn't have the time to refine them more.

## Misc

- I recomended [Luc Sante's The Other Paris](https://www.bookforum.com/print/2203/luc-sante-s-flaneur-s-eye-guide-to-the-underside-of-paris-14966), an exploration of the marginal people and places in historical Paris, several times this holiday break. The attention to working class entertainments and spaces seems somehow resonnant to me right now. Even though contemporary urban space makes less and less room for this kind of demonstrative physical underbelly, the impulses to carve a collective working people's psychic space in the face of external insanity feels particularly current.

Free from daytime work obligations, I walked through a few personal ghost landscapes of New York City this holiday break registering the feelings of _home-ishness_ that well up on various points. Perhaps it is parenthood, but I'm feeling older and also more nostalgic for the terrain and the physical markers that imprinted on me in my first few years in the City. I find that the _homeishness_ feeling does not map to length of time in a particular place or frequency of visits, but more to a sense of authenticity or to how tightly I gripped those places to attempt to adhere them to a self that seemed dangerously mutable at the time.
