## Lesson in Lessness

30 days have passed. What do I have to show for myself? I had endevoured to complete loads of projects. What did I actually finish?

This was far less than I had originally hoped, but it seems **lessness is my lesson** for this month.

I inadvertently made one project two by committing to blog daily about my progress. As a parent to a small child and full-time employee, I had only enough time each day to do a bit of work or post on said work, but not both. After 4 days, I chose to give up blogging in favor of actual productivity.

30 minutes a day for 30 days turns out to have been the about the time I needed to crochet one blanket. I had hoped to do more work on code projects, but once I picked up the blanket, I wanted to see that through to completion. I did not predict that it would take nearly so long.

We shall see in month 2 if I can handle coding after putting O to bed. ü§û

## What I finished

I finished [this lovely shell crochet blanket](https://melaniekham.com/turtle-shell-crochet-blanket/) for baby O's naptime. It's warm for the winter but still plenty breatheable.

## What I learned

I had expected to be thrilled or at least relieved at finishing a project, however my strongest feeling was disappointment. The blanket is a bit boring and the edges wobble. I was also feeling **em¬∑bar¬∑rassed** to have made such a public declaration and to achieve so little.

Once again, my mental metronome tick-tocks **not enough**.

Avoiding the disappointment of my own shortcomings is the chief driver of my finishitis. (If I never finish, I can always project that it will be completed perfectly in the imaginary future.)

This kind of thinking keeps me small and ashamed. If I do nothing, I get nothing. I only improve if I keep going. I chose to own my small actions and keep going.

## What is next

I'd like to keep up my habit of 30 minutes of daily project time with work on my ok,not-ok web project. Ideally, I can get this completed by the new year! I'll endeavor to update when I can!

## Misc

Want to read other people owning up to finishitis and failure, in 2010 Artist Cory Arcangel put together a project called [‚ÄúSorry I Haven‚Äôt Posted‚Äù](http://www.coryarcangel.com/news/2010/08/sorry-i-havnt-posted/) cataloging people apologizing to the internet for not posting.
